  <p class="text-gray-500 mb-8 max-w-2xl">
    This application was developed as part of a technical assessment. The objective was to create a web application
    for managing and visualizing maritime-related data. The project includes a C# backend (ASP.NET Core REST API),
    an Angular frontend, and utilizes an SQL database to store information about Ships, Voyages, Ports, and Countries visited.
    The application demonstrates data retrieval and display from these entities, with potential for future expansion to include
    Create, Update, and Delete operations, state management (NgRx), and unit testing.
